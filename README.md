# Full Stack Open: Submissions Repository ðŸ’»

Thank you to the **University of Helsinki** for creating **Full Stack Open** and allowing me to submit my exercises. 
This repository will be regularly switched between public and private to help prevent plagiarism.


# What's this then? ðŸ¤”

**Full Stack Open** is a course provided by the University of Helsinki that anyone, anywhere can take. Full Stack Open teaches students the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js & React) technology stack, and provides exercises, assignments and projects to complete. 

There is no set deadline to the course, however for university credits and/or completion awards, there is a date each year that the course should receive its final submissions. More information about Full Stack Open can be found [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about).

# That sounds cool! How do I sign up? âœ¨

Just head on over to **[Full Stack Open's syllabus](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)** and get cracking. It's completely free, and teaches the exact same course as what is taught in the University of Helsinki's full-stack web development course in their computer science degree.

# Where's part 3?

Part 3 is in its own separate repository due to the nature of the way the submissions are built - requiring the application to be a complete full-stack project and deployable to heroku. Please visit /fso-submissions-part3 for Part 3!
